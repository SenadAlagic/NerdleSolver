# NerdleSolver

My attempt at making a "bot" that solves the daily Nerdle challenges. This kind of automation is fun and I get to practice Python and Selenium. 

Edit: This was sort of a proof of concept for myself. I would like to finish this but I'm afraid, for now at least, it will sit as an unfinished project.
